# SPARQL queries
This repo is an assortment of various SPARQL queries I've written to explore key data stores in the semantic web. These examples demonstrate various functionalities of SPARQL such as federated queries, filters, bindings, and joins. They are also meant to demonstrate the various ways in which queried data can be presented to users, such as in tables or maps.
